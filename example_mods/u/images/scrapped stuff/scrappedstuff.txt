Here are some scrapped things for the mod.

1: Originally it was supposed to have warnings for ram usage, but was eventaully scrapped
and removed from the mod.

2: Sussus endus was supposed to be only playable after susogus but was scrapped
due to the concept not working with save stuff cause idk that much about save data
and not fitting in with the mod.

3: There was going to be a legacy edition added into the mod but was scrapped and
made a seperate download and only works in psych engine 0.6.3 without breaking.

4: Mania charts were going to be added but susogus made it difficult and was scrapped.

5: Susogus wasn't originally planned for the mod but was added after realizing how
simple sussus endus was going to be. That wasn't true btw, sussus endus was pretty
complicated but they both made it into the mod thankfully.
